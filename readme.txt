houCe is client oriented web framework designed with conventions that help you get ready and going in seconds, while providing structure that supports complex desktop like applications. houCe aspires to use one language for everything it does, and that language is CoffeeScript. Here's the list of other technologies:

* Node.js
* Express.js
* CoffeeKup
* Sugar.js
* LESS (CCSS implementation coming later)
